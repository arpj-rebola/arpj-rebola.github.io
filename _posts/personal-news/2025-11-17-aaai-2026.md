title: New paper 'Faster Certified Symmetry Breaking using Orders with Auxiliary Variables' accepted at AAAI&nbsp;2026
---

<p>
In this paper we present an extension to the proof system underlying VeriPB that allows the use of auxiliary preorder variables for dominance-based redundancy. This leads to substantial improvements
in proof logging and checking for symmetry breaking.
