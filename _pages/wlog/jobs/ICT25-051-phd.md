<h1>Phd Student Project Assistant position on Model Checking and Automated Reasoning</h1>

<div class="summary">
We advertise a funded position at the
<a href="{{ site.data.wlog.affiliation-url }}">{{ site.data.wlog.affiliation }} ({{ site.data.wlog.affiliation-short }})</a>

supported by the
<a href="{{ site.data.wlog.funding-url }}">{{ site.data.wlog.funding }} ({{ site.data.wlog.funding-short }})</a>.
Successful applicants will work on the extension of techniques for reasoning and certification without loss of generality
from SAT solving and combinatorial optimization (e.g. redundance, dominance) to hardware model checking.
This project targets a tighter integration of user input in model checkers
as a middle ground between push-button model checking and proof assistant-based verification.
