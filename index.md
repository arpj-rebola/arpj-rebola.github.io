<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Postdoctoral University Assistant in the [Forsyte Research Unit](https://forsyte.at/) at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at/), as well as in the [Institute for Symbolic Artificial Intelligence](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-for-symbolic-artificial-intelligence/) at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at).

My research focuses on **solver certification** and **data extraction from proofs**, especially within the context of reasoning without loss of generality in finite domains (SAT/QBF). As of lately I am transitioning into a broader scope including **model checking**, **interactive software verification** and untapped use cases for logic-based solvers (specifically, **flexible scheduling** and **procedural content generation**). If you are interested in academic collaboration in either of these topics, please send me an email.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [Forsyte Research Unit](https://forsyte.at/) at TU Wien under the supervision of [Georg Weissenbacher](https://www.georg.weissenbacher.science/). As a part of the [LogiCS doctoral college](https://www.vcla.at/msca/programme/), I was also co-supervised by [Armin Biere](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/biere/). Previously I got my MSc in Computational Logic from [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/) and [Free University of Bolzano](https://www.unibz.it/). I also spent some time at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) and [the lab formerly known as NICTA](https://research.csiro.au/data61/).
